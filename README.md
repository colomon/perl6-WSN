perl6-WSN
=========

Initial p6 experiments with understanding Wirth syntax notation.

2/16/2015: Brought up to current Rakudo standards. It sort of works now. The
big limitation here seems to be that WSN's optional whitespace is hard to make
work automatically in p6. However, this script's output certainly gives one an
okay starting point for translating WSN to a p6 grammar.
